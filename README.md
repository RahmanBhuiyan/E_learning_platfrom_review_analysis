# A Study of student satisfaction in e learning platform

## Description

This project aims to improve the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of an e-learning platform from the perspective of students. The research focuses on identifying areas for improvement in the platform's navigation, organization of content, and accessibility of resources. Data was collected through a survey administered to students using a sample dataset from Kaggle. The results of the survey were analyzed using statistical analysis techniques to gain insights and make recommendations for enhancing the UI/UX of the platform.
